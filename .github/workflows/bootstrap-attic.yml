# GHA backed attic server for nix binary caches
# This workflow does something weird and crazy
# - It builds attic and runs it and exposes it in a cloudflare tunnel
# -- * Then one can use that url as a substitutor and install attic
# -- * This can be extended to build anything and expose it via attic
# - Why not use cachix? good question, maybe because it is not oss
# - Also caches nix store in github actions cache
# TODO:
# other whacky ideas
# - push to a list of minio backed private attic servers
#   without exposing their endpoints (github secrets)
